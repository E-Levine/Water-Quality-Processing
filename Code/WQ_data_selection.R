####Water Quality Data Selection###
#
##Selection of WQ stations for data from WQ Portal or Atlas cleaned files
#If other data sources are needed, submit a request to EWilliams (or via the github repo:https://github.com/E-Levine/Water-Quality-Processing)
##Output of selected data and map

#Use Alt+O to collapse all sections, Alt+Shift+O to expand all sections

#Load require packages (install as necessary)
